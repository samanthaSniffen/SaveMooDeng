      <h2><em>Who We Are</em></h2>
      <br>
      <p>We are a team of four students from Stevenson University, excited to participate in the UMBC Hackathon.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our project focuses on the endangered Pygmy Hippopotamus, inspired by the viral sensation Moo Deng. Born in July at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Chon Buri, Thailand, Moo Deng captured the hearts of millions with adorable videos of her bathing, sleeping, and nibbling, shared by her zookeeper, Atthapon Nundee. With over 2.5 million fans, Moo Deng's fame has brought attention to the plight of pygmy hippos, and we are motivated to further raise awareness about the threats they face.</p>
